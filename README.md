# Our Story
Inspired by our economics classes, we decided to tackle the small business challenge and try to apply our knowledge of economics to promote healthy competition within industries. Small businesses often face challenges with regards to economies of scale, as they tend to order less bulk material than large companies and thus have to pay higher unit prices, causing them to charge more to even out profits and lose out to larger companies' cheaper pricesâ€”which becomes a vicious cycle.

Our project will coordinate bulk orders to be shared among small business owners with similar needs. We hope that through Chip, where everyone chips in, small business can thrive in increasingly monopolistic industries, and that the success of a business will be determined by the quality of its product, not its pre-existing scale.
